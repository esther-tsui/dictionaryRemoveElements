# dictionaryRemoveElements
a reminder for myself on Dictionaries - removing elements: when using the the .removeValue() method -> syntax: dictionaryName.removeValue(forKey: Key)
you are putting the KEY NAME in the end, NOT the value. 
In the exercise, you should put the Key "pink" after 'forKey', not "#ffc0cb". "#ffc0cb" is the value, NOT Key.
